                        I designed updates to test stations that perform missile validation and re-certification.  The work included talking with the customer and determining which processes could be improved or automated.

                        C programming of a data-acquisition board to accept multiple inputs from acoustic sensors, process the data, and output the results in real-time.

                        Developed algorithms for autonomous vehicles that describe simple behaviors.  Each of these behaviors produced a desired course and speed required to carry out a mission and abide by any "rules of the road" while avoiding terrain, restricted areas, and other vehicles.  Each of these behaviors were then integrated in the existing MOOS and IvPHelp frameworks to determine the optimal course of action.

                        Built a Matlab GUI that read the output image data from a FLIR CCD camera, applied geometric and calibration corrections to the image, then processed the data to determine fluence, intensity, and power levels collected.

                        Designed, developed, and implemented tests for a variety of research applications.  The entire process included selection, manufacturing of custom test hardware, debugging and iterating, and maintaining proper documentation.  I would then report and defend any test results to a team of engineers and managers.
